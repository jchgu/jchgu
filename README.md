I study social data science to shed light on societal issues. From time to time, we encounter "[wicked problems](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-94580-0)" like discrimination and inequality. [According to Brian Head](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-94580-0_1), these problems have multiple causes and assume different shapes; They "involve conflicting interests and divergent perceptions among various stakeholder groups". My research investigates how individuals and institutions respond to these problems. For example, how do rural children fare at school when their parents have migrated away to make a living? How did Twitter users express sentiments in discussions on electoral politics, at the time when Capitol storming was unfolding? To do so, I develop econometric models using social survey data, or undertake computational content analysis using online text data.

I have studied and worked in China, the Netherlands, and Austria. I am working as a PhD Researcher in Migration Studies at the Universität für Weiterbildung Krems. Before that, I earned an MSc degree in Societal Resilience: Social Sciences for a Digital Society from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
