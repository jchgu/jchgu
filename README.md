I study social data science to shed light on societal issues. From time to time, we encounter "[wicked problems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf01405730)" such as discrimination and inequality. These problems are multifaceted; We trace them to different causes, which may be another wicked problem. My research investigates how individuals and institutions respond to these problems. For example, how do rural children fare at school when their parents have migrated away to make a living? How did Twitter users express sentiments in discussions on electoral politics, at the time when Capitol storming was unfolding? To do so, I develop econometric models using social survey data, or undertake computational content analysis using online text data.

I earned an MSc degree in Societal Resilience: Big Data for Society from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
